## üìÑ Features & Usage Guide

### 1. Serving Static Files

- **Description:**
  The server can serve static files (HTML, CSS, etc.) located in the same directory.
- **How it works:**
  If a user accesses `/filename`, the server will send that file if it exists and is safe.
- **Instructions:**
  Place your HTML/CSS files in the same folder, then access them via browser:
  `http://localhost:8080/index.html`

### 2. POST Request (Save Data)

- **Description:**
  The server accepts POST data and saves it to the file `post_result.txt`.
- **How it works:**
  The body data from the POST request will be written to the file.
- **Instructions:**
  Send data using curl or another tool:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -d "data" http://localhost:8080
  ```

### 3. PUT & DELETE (Update & Delete File)

- **Description:**
  Supports updating files (PUT) and deleting files (DELETE) with filename validation.
- **How it works:**
  - PUT: Overwrites or creates a new file.
  - DELETE: Deletes a file if the name is valid.
- **Instructions:**
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT --data-binary @file.txt http://localhost:8080/file.txt
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/file.txt
  ```

### 4. Navigation & Search Endpoint (Frontend) [Creativity]

- **Description:**
  The HTML page includes navigation and a search feature to easily switch endpoints.
- **How it works:**
  Users can type a filename and will be redirected to that endpoint.
  If the file cannot be accessed, it will give 404 Not Found or 400 Bad Request, depending on the file type.
- **Instructions:**
  Open `index.html` in your browser and use the search bar.

### 5. Port Forwarding

- **Description:**
  This can be port forwarded using ngrok.
- **Instructions:**
  Run the server. Then,
  Type:
  ```bash
  ngrok http 8080
  ```

## üîç Usage Examples

### Serving Static Files

```
http://localhost:8080/filename.html
```

The root path (`/`) will serve `index.html`.

### POST Requests

```bash
curl -X POST -d "Your data here" http://localhost:8080
```

POST data will be saved to `post_result.txt`.

### PUT Requests

Create or update files:

```bash
curl -X PUT -d "File content" http://localhost:8080/newfile.txt
```

### DELETE Requests

Remove files:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/file-to-delete.txt
```

## üîß Technical Details

This server is built using:

- Raw socket with Linux syscalls
- x86-64 assembly for core functionality
- C for security helper functions
- Process-based concurrency model

## üîí Security

All file operations include path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks. The server validates filenames before processing any request.

## üìù Note

This server is primarily designed for educational purposes to demonstrate low-level systems programming. While functional, it lacks many features of production-ready servers.
