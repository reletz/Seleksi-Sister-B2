# 4-bit Fisherman

## Project Description

This project is a 4-bit computer simulation built using Minecraft. The simulation consists of CPU and memory components, where the CPU can receive number and operation inputs via buttons or switches, and the memory is used to store the output from the tests.

Specifications:

- The first bit is used for the sign, so the format is 1 sign bit + 3 number bits.
- The CPU component must have an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- The computer simulation is tested by performing basic arithmetic operations, namely addition and subtraction.
- Number and operation inputs are given via buttons or switches.
- The output of the operation is stored in memory.

## Implementation

This simulation is built in Minecraft using redstone, buttons, switches, and other relevant components. The main simulated components include:

1. **CPU**

- Receives number and operation inputs (addition/subtraction) via buttons or switches.
- Contains an ALU to perform basic arithmetic operations.

2. **Memory**

- Stores the output results from the operations performed by the CPU.

3. **Display**

- Can show the input and output in seven-segment display.

## Testing

The simulation is tested by performing addition and subtraction operations on 4-bit numbers (with 1 sign bit). The results can be observed in the memory output.

## Notes

The entire project and simulation are carried out in Minecraft. ([My Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n5BzWLokUN5wkM-dZEHNISBS0zbR3aKF/view?usp=sharing))
